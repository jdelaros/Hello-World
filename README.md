# Hello-World
This is my Git Hub greeting to the World

Hi, my name is Jon D.L.R, I am 18 years old with many ambitions. I currently go to college, I intern at a top company in Wisconsin, I try to hit the gym 6 days a week, I am interested in what the world of code has to offer. I look forward into learning as many languages as I can from CSS to Python. I would like to someday make a positive change to the world were I can forever be remembered as someone that was caring and dedicated to making the world a better place by helping others.
